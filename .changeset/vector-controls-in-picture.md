Vector effects declare their controls in their picture: the first `{{name: type …}}` placeholder (`float`, `int`, `bool`, `color` or `text`, with `@control`'s attributes) declares a control, and `vectorControls` reads them, the way `parseControls` reads a shader's. Adds a `text` control type (shown as a text field in the parameters panel), so a picture's words can be changed; text is escaped when filled in. `drip-text` now takes any word, with its drips following it. Every catalog vector effect declares its controls inline, and a vector effect's `controls` list is now optional (still read, for effects written before). `renderVectorEffect` drops comments from the markup and falls back to defaults for values a control cannot take.
